Ownership is usually acquired as a consequence of creating the object or via specified ownership assignment. DAC allows the owner to determine who will have access to objects they control. An example of DAC includes user-controlled file permissions.      When discretionary access control policies are implemented, subjects are not constrained with regard to what actions they can take with information for which they have already been granted access.

Ownership is usually acquired as a consequence of creating the object or via specified ownership assignment. DAC allows the owner to determine who will have access to objects they control. An example of DAC includes user-controlled file permissions.

This set of events is typically a subset of the list of all events for which the system is capable of generating audit records.      DoD has defined the list of events for which the Ubuntu operating system will provide an audit record generation capability as the following:      1) Successful and unsuccessful attempts to access, modify, or delete privileges, security objects, security levels, or categories of information (e.g., classification levels);      2) Access actions, such as successful and unsuccessful logon attempts, privileged activities or other system-level access, starting and ending time for user access to the system, concurrent logons from different workstations, successful and unsuccessful accesses to objects, all program initiations, and all direct access to the information system;      3) All account creations, modifications, disabling, and terminations; and      4) All kernel module load, unload, and restart actions.\n\nWithout the capability to generate audit records, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify those responsible for one.

                "description": "Timely patching is critical for maintaining the operational availability, confidentiality, and integrity of information technology (IT) systems. However, failure to keep Ubuntu operating system and application software patched is a common mistake made by IT professionals. New patches are released daily, and it is often difficult for even experienced System Administrators to keep abreast of all the new patches. When new weaknesses in an Ubuntu operating system exist, patches are usually made available by the vendor to resolve the problems. If the most recent security patches and updates are not installed, unauthorized users may take advantage of weaknesses in the unpatched software. The lack of prompt attention to patching could result in a system compromise.\n\nIf an account has an empty password, anyone could log on and run commands with the privileges of that account. Accounts with empty passwords should never be used in operational environments.\n\nIf the Ubuntu operating system allows the user to select passwords based on dictionary words, this increases the chances of password compromise by increasing the opportunity for successful guesses and brute-force attacks.\n\nIf the Ubuntu operating system allows the user to select passwords based on dictionary words, this increases the chances of password compromise by increasing the opportunity for successful guesses and brute-force attacks.\n\nLimiting the number of logon attempts over a certain time interval reduces the chances that an unauthorized user may gain access to an account.\n\nFailure to restrict system access to authenticated users negatively impacts Ubuntu operating system security.\n\nProviding users with feedback on when account accesses last occurred facilitates user recognition and reporting of unauthorized account use.\n\nThe .shosts files are used to configure host-based authentication for individual users or the system via SSH. Host-based authentication is not sufficient for preventing unauthorized access to the system, as it does not require interactive identification and authentication of a connection request, or for the use of two-factor authentication.\n\nThe shosts.equiv files are used to configure host-based authentication for the system via SSH. Host-based authentication is not sufficient for preventing unauthorized access to the system, as it does not require interactive identification and authentication of a connection request, or for the use of two-factor authentication.\n\nACLs can provide permissions beyond those permitted through the file mode and must be verified by file integrity tools.\n\nExtended attributes in file systems are used to contain arbitrary data and file metadata with security implications.\n\nAutomatically mounting file systems permits easy introduction of unknown devices, thereby facilitating malicious activity.\n\nA locally logged-on user who presses Ctrl-Alt-Delete, when at the console, can reboot the system. If accidentally pressed, as could happen in the case of a mixed OS environment, this can create the risk of short-term loss of availability of systems due to unintentional reboot. In the GNOME graphical environment, risk of unintentional reboot from the Ctrl-Alt-Delete sequence is reduced because the user will be prompted before any action is taken.\n\nSetting the most restrictive default permissions ensures that when new accounts are created they do not have unnecessary access.\n\nAccounts providing no operational purpose provide additional opportunities for system compromise. Unnecessary accounts include user accounts for individuals not requiring access to the system and application accounts for applications not installed on the system.\n\nIf an account other than root also has a User Identifier (UID) of \"0\", it has root authority, giving that account unrestricted access to the entire Ubuntu operating system. Multiple accounts with a UID of \"0\" afford an opportunity for potential intruders to guess a password for a privileged account.\n\nIf local interactive users are not assigned a valid home directory, there is no place for the storage and control of files they should own.\n\nIf local interactive users are not assigned a valid home directory, there is no place for the storage and control of files they should own.\n\nIf a local interactive user has a home directory defined that does not exist, the user may be given access to the / directory as the current working directory upon logon. This could create a Denial of Service because the user would not be able to access their logon configuration files, and it may give them visibility to system files they normally would not be able to access.\n\nExcessive permissions on local interactive user home directories may allow unauthorized access to user files by other users.\n\nIf the Group Identifier (GID) of a local interactive user\u2019s home directory is not the same as the primary GID of the user, this would allow unauthorized access to the user\u2019s files, and users that share the same group may not be able to access files that they legitimately should.\n\nLocal initialization files are used to configure the user's shell environment upon logon. Malicious modification of these files could compromise accounts upon logon.\n\nThe executable search path (typically the PATH environment variable) contains a list of directories for the shell to search to find executables. If this path includes the current working directory executables in these directories may be executed instead of system commands. This variable is formatted as a colon-separated list of directories. If there is an empty entry, such as a leading or trailing colon or two consecutive colons, this is interpreted as the current working directory. If deviations from the default system search path for the local interactive user are required, they must be documented with the Information System Security Officer (ISSO).\n\nIf user start-up files execute world-writable programs, especially in unprotected directories, they could be maliciously modified to destroy user files or otherwise compromise the system at the user level. If the system is compromised at the user level, it is easier to elevate privileges to eventually compromise the system at the root and network level.\n\nThe \"nosuid\" mount option causes the system to not execute setuid and setgid files with owner privileges. This option must be used for mounting any file system not containing approved setuid and setguid files. Executing files from untrusted file systems increases the opportunity for unprivileged users to attain unauthorized administrative access.\n\nThe \"nosuid\" mount option causes the system to not execute \"setuid\" and \"setgid\" files with owner privileges.

This option must be used for mounting any file system not containing approved binary files as they may be incompatible. Executing files from untrusted file systems increases the opportunity for unprivileged users to attain unauthorized administrative access.\n\nIf a world-writable directory has the sticky bit set and is not group-owned by a privileged Group Identifier (GID), unauthorized users may be able to modify files created by others.      The only authorized public directories are those temporary directories supplied with the system or those designed to be temporary file repositories. The setting is normally reserved for directories used by the system and by users for temporary file storage, (e.g., /tmp), and for directories requiring global read/write access.\n\nKernel core dumps may contain the full contents of system memory at the time of the crash. Kernel core dumps may consume a considerable amount of disk space and may result in denial of service by exhausting the available space on the target file system partition.\n\nThe use of separate file systems for different paths can protect the system from failures resulting from a file system becoming full or failing.\n\nThe use of separate file systems for different paths can protect the system from failures resulting from a file system becoming full or failing.\n\nThe use of separate file systems for different paths can protect the system from failures resulting from a file system becoming full or failing.\n\nFirewalls protect computers from network attacks by blocking or limiting access to open network ports. Application firewalls limit which applications are allowed to communicate over the network.\n\nFailure to restrict network connectivity only to authorized systems permits inbound connections from malicious systems. It also permits outbound connections that may facilitate exfiltration of DoD data.\n\nEven though the communications channel may be encrypted, an additional layer of security is gained by extending the policy of not logging on directly as root. In addition, logging on with a user-specific account provides individual accountability of actions performed on the system.\n\nFailure to restrict system access to authenticated users negatively impacts Ubuntu operating system security.\n\nProviding users with feedback on when account accesses via SSH last occurred facilitates user recognition and reporting of unauthorized account use.\n\nConfiguring this setting for the SSH daemon provides additional assurance that remote logon via SSH will require a password, even in the event of misconfiguration elsewhere.\n\nIf a public host key file is modified by an unauthorized user, the SSH service may be compromised.\n\nIf an unauthorized user obtains the private SSH host key file, the host could be impersonated.\n\nIf other users have access to modify user-specific SSH configuration files, they may be able to log on to the system as another user.\n\nSSH daemon privilege separation causes the SSH process to drop root privileges when not needed, which would decrease the impact of software vulnerabilities in the unprivileged section.\n\nIf compression is allowed in an SSH connection prior to authentication, vulnerabilities in the compression software could result in compromise of the system from an unauthenticated connection, potentially with root privileges.\n\nOpen X displays allow an attacker to capture keystrokes and execute commands remotely.\n\nCron logging can be used to trace the successful or unsuccessful execution of cron jobs. It can also be used to spot intrusions into the use of the cron facility by unauthorized and malicious users.\n\nTo provide availability for name resolution services, multiple redundant name servers are mandated. A failure in name resolution could lead to the failure of security functions requiring name resolution, which may include time synchronization, centralized authentication, and remote system logging.\n\nSource-routed packets allow the source of the packet to suggest that routers forward the packet along a different path than configured on the router, which can be used to bypass network security measures. This requirement applies only to the forwarding of source-routed traffic, such as when IPv4 forwarding is enabled and the system is functioning as a router.\n\nSource-routed packets allow the source of the packet to suggest that routers forward the packet along a different path than configured on the router, which can be used to bypass network security measures.

These messages modify the host's route table and are unauthenticated. An illicit ICMP redirect message could result in a man-in-the-middle attack.\n\nInternet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) redirect messages are used by routers to inform hosts that a more direct route exists for a particular destination.

These messages contain information from the system's route table, possibly revealing portions of the network topology.\n\nRouting protocol daemons are typically used on routers to exchange network topology information with other routers. If this software is used when not required, system network information may be unnecessarily transmitted across the network.\n\nNetwork interfaces in promiscuous mode allow for the capture of all network traffic visible to the system. If unauthorized individuals can access these applications, it may allow then to collect information such as logon IDs, passwords, and key exchanges between systems.      If the system is being used to perform a network troubleshooting function, the use of these tools must be documented with the Information System Security Officer (ISSO) and restricted to only authorized personnel.\n\nIf unrestricted mail relaying is permitted, unauthorized senders could use this host as a mail relay for the purpose of sending spam or other unauthorized activity.\n\nThe FTP service provides an unencrypted remote access that does not provide for the confidentiality and integrity of user passwords or the remote session. If a privileged user were to log on using this service, the privileged user password could be compromised. SSH or other encrypted file transfer methods must be used in place of this service.\n\nRestricting TFTP to a specific directory prevents remote users from copying, transferring, or overwriting system files.\n\nInternet services that are not required for system or application processes must not be active to decrease the attack surface of the system. X Windows has a long history of security vulnerabilities and will not be used unless approved and documented.\n\nA locally logged-on user who presses Ctrl-Alt-Delete, when at the console, can reboot the system. If accidentally pressed, as could happen in the case of a mixed OS environment, this can create the risk of short-term loss of availability of systems due to unintentional reboot. In the GNOME graphical environment, risk of unintentional reboot from the Ctrl-Alt-Delete sequence is reduced because the user will be prompted before any action is taken.\n\nConfiguring the Ubuntu operating system to implement organization-wide security implementation guides and security checklists ensures compliance with federal standards and establishes a common security baseline across DoD that reflects the most restrictive security posture consistent with operational requirements.      Configuration settings are the set of parameters that can be changed in hardware, software, or firmware components of the system that affect the security posture and/or functionality of the system. Security-related parameters are those parameters impacting the security state of the system, including the parameters required to satisfy other security control requirements. Security-related parameters include, for example: registry settings; account, file, directory permission settings; and settings for functions, ports, protocols, services, and remote connections.",

However, failure to keep Ubuntu operating system and application software patched is a common mistake made by IT professionals. New patches are released daily, and it is often difficult for even experienced System Administrators to keep abreast of all the new patches. When new weaknesses in an Ubuntu operating system exist, patches are usually made available by the vendor to resolve the problems. If the most recent security patches and updates are not installed, unauthorized users may take advantage of weaknesses in the unpatched software. The lack of prompt attention to patching could result in a system compromise.\n\nIf an account has an empty password, anyone could log on and run commands with the privileges of that account. Accounts with empty passwords should never be used in operational environments.\n\nIf the Ubuntu operating system allows the user to select passwords based on dictionary words, this increases the chances of password compromise by increasing the opportunity for successful guesses and brute-force attacks.\n\nIf the Ubuntu operating system allows the user to select passwords based on dictionary words, this increases the chances of password compromise by increasing the opportunity for successful guesses and brute-force attacks.\n\nLimiting the number of logon attempts over a certain time interval reduces the chances that an unauthorized user may gain access to an account.\n\nFailure to restrict system access to authenticated users negatively impacts Ubuntu operating system security.\n\nProviding users with feedback on when account accesses last occurred facilitates user recognition and reporting of unauthorized account use.\n\nThe .shosts files are used to configure host-based authentication for individual users or the system via SSH.

Security function is defined as the hardware, software, and/or firmware of the information system responsible for enforcing the system security policy and supporting the isolation of code and data on which the protection is based. Security functionality includes, but is not limited to, establishing system accounts, configuring access authorizations (i.e., permissions, privileges), setting events to be audited, and setting intrusion detection parameters.
